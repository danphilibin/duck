# Duck

A daily programming notepad for macOS. Made with [create-tauri-app](https://github.com/tauri-apps/create-tauri-app).

On first launch, Duck will prompt you to choose a storage location. Duck will write your notes to daily Markdown files in the location you choose.

⚠️ _Due to an issue with Tauri's persistent storage plugin, you **must** store your files in a subfolder within `~/Documents`. I hope to fix this soon, sorry!_
