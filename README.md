# Duck

Duck is a daily programming notepad that floats on top of your other windows and writes daily Markdown files to disk. That's about all it does for now, but I'm excited to add more functionality soon.

On first launch, Duck will prompt you to choose a storage location. Duck will write your notes to daily Markdown files in the location you choose.

⚠️ _Due to an issue with Tauri's persistent storage plugin, you **must** store your files in a subfolder within `~/Documents`. I hope to fix this soon, sorry!_
