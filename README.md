# Duck

Duck is a daily programming notepad that floats on top of your other windows and writes daily Markdown files to disk.

For a while I've used Floating Notes in [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com) as a notepad, but it doesn't have formatting and doesn't automatically save its contents everywhere. So for v0.1, Duck is basically my own version of Floating Notes with formatting and autosaving.

On first launch, Duck will prompt you to choose a storage location. Duck will write your notes to daily Markdown files in the location you choose.
